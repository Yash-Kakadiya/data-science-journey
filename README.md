# Data Science Journey

This repository contains my ongoing work, code practice, and learning notes as I progress through my Data Science and MLOps journey.  
I’ll be uploading hands-on notebooks, exercises, and mini projects as I move through different topics like Python, Data Analysis, Machine Learning, and MLOps.

---

## 📘 Current Focus
- Python programming fundamentals  
- Data types, loops, and functions  
- Numpy and Pandas basics  
- Exploratory data analysis  

---

## 🚀 Future Topics
- Data visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn  
- SQL for data analysis  
- Machine learning models and projects  
- MLOps tools like MLflow, Docker, and AWS
